Now it's time to prepare for 2 of the toughest bosses in the entire game.
And those 2 items, not to mention the 2 golden toys you got, will really come in handy.
So after you've stocked up on items, grabbed your toughest pants, picked your most powerful
weapons, and saved your game, head back to mt bolbo, to fight Tsundele Devil.

==========[FIGHT - Tsundele Devil]========================================================

Once she's defeated, you'll get another cutscene.
When the cutscene begins, Tsundele Devil vanishes just as Mercedes shows up.
And just as you think you've won for good, mercedes transforms into Empress Erotica.
As it turns out, you were learning all your techniques from her all this time.
Mercedes was the one that took you from the castle, but she killed him and took his
place 1 month later. He was just going to teach you fencing, but instead you were put
through the rigors of sexual training. She didn't think you would survive, but you did.
Why? Because she could not defeat you when you were 8 years, and now she wants a rematch.
This battle however will not be easily won, in fact, it's dang near impossable since
you had to go through a tough fight already, and you haven't had time to recover.
So the easyiest thing to do is let yourself lose. Sure you lose half your money,
but you'll be able to go back later completely recharged, and not have to fight
Tsundele Devil first again. You can jump right into this battle, so I suggest you do that.

==========[FIGHT - Erotica]===============================================================

When you defeat Empress Erotica, she says as she leaves...
At last, My lineage's hope has finally come true, I am grateful to you.
As the credits roll by, a picture forms on the right side.
A picture of Empress Erotica happily pregnant. That's right, she used you.
This whole 10 year attack of hers was nothing but a big trap.
She chose you, and now she has what she wants.
But succubus take 100 years to give birth, so you have a temporary truce.
(so says the guy that shows up down there, if you talk to him)

CONGRATS... You defeated the main boss. HOWEVER...
If you really want to finish the game and see the last cutscene, You'll continue.










When you get back to the surface, you'll notice that there are no longer any random
battles what-so-ever anymore. But there's still one thing left for you to do.
Go back, and comeplete devildom. Because now that Tsundele Devil is defeated, your path
to the lower levels is no longer blocked. So take what ever path you want to get back
to the entrance to the lower levels. ALSO, bring a star, and buy 1 crappy pants.
Try the the random store just outside spring village, all explain later.
Unlike the topside world, there are still random battles in devildom.

----------[MAP 38]------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------[MAP 39]------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you head down the stairs on the 4th floor of devildom to the 5th floor,
the first thing you might notice is that there is nothing you can do here.
All the chests on this level, aren't connected to this wallway.
So continue to the 6th floor. When you reach the 6th floor, start heading down the path,
and take the first turn to the right. Follow it and take the stairs to one of the chests
back on the 5th floor, and then backtrack to continue down. The next turn in the path
will divide too. The right path goes back up to another chest with a mimic enemy in it,
so get it, and then come back down. The next thing you want to do is go left and use your
star. Then talk to the cloaked figure at the end of the path. This succubus basically says
that she's tired of eating sheep and want to taste human flesh again. But instead of you,
she wants to eat the old man living in this area of devildom. In exchange, she'll give you
extremely rare pants. So despite being human too, go talk to the old man at the bottom of
the map. Talk to him twice. The first time he tells you that he's trapped here, and he
wants your help to get back to the human world. The second time, when you tell him that
that succubus over there wants to eat him, he goes "woe is me" for a little bit, and then
offers you 2 items if you'll help him. So go get the two items. Head for the third stairs
that you didn't take before, and take them back up to the 5th floor. Instead of going up
the center, head down and around. The two items are the last two spaces at the end.
Don't worry about the last two chests, because you'll get them much later.
Now go back to where you talked to the succubus, and use the spice on the guard in gold.
Disturbing spice that makes things taste like whatever the eater wishes it to be.
Now equip the crappy pants I told you to buy, and talk to the succubus one more time.
She thanks you for bringing the delicious looking meat, and tells you that because she
promised, she will swap your pants for hers. Now aren't you glad your not wearing your
good pants anymore. Now check out the store down here. If you remember the catgirl from
random store 3 that's by volcano village, you should know that she has 2 stores in
devildom. One here and one on the 7th floor. And these are the ONLY places where you can
buy Angel's tears and Gold Cream in the entire world. Now on to the 7th floor.

----------[MAP 40]------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's not much to do here on the 7th floor, but jump right into the next story section.
Don't worry about the 2 exits in the top and right corners, we'll get them later.
So go to the outcropping in the center of the room and talk to the 2 girls.
They say that after spending time in the human world, they started to like it there.
And now they are being punished for trying to introduce the idea that succubus and humans
could live together in peace. Now they want you to help them get back to the human world
so they can at least say goodbye to their friends, before they get executed for their
traitorous act. You need to help them, but how? Go talk to the "Information man" in the
north section just under the graveyard. Talk to him twice, and he says that if you want to
help the sisters, you need to get rid of the lava, so you should go talk to the inventor
in the tower that's in the south section. Go to the tower, but when you try to enter,
you find out that the door is locked, so go back to talk to the "Information man" again.
He says that maybe the mayor has the key, and you should go to his house in the western
district. Now head back to the tower, unlock it, and go inside to talk to the guy there.
He says that he'll make you a bomb if you bring him some gunpowder. But where do you get
gunpowder? Go ask the "information man" again. He says that no such thing exists here,
but that gunghoul had quite a lot. So you must head all the way back to where you fought
gunghoul in the caves, by the Southeastern Port. The gunpowder is right where she was
standing. Once you have the gunpowder, prepare for the next boss fight, and then head back
down to give it to the inventor. You are asked once again to wait for a while, and once
again there's a handy way you can use to speed up time. Head out, go upstairs to the 6th
floor, then come back down, and go see him again. Talk to him again and then take the bomb
from the chest. Go over to the lava-fall and set the bomb. After the explosion, you'll be
warped to an underground chamber where you'll have to fight the two sisters. As it turns out
they were lying to you, and just wanted you to open the gates of hell. Oops.

==========[FIGHT - MOE sisters]===========================================================

After you defeat them, exit through the only door, and grab the chest nearby.
Now the majority of the people that were standing around on this floor, are gone.
The only ones that are left, say that sence the gates to hell have been opened, everyone
is doomed, both the succubus world AND the human world. So you know what to do, right?
That's right, you have to go to hell, fight all the bad guys, which just happen to consist
of every BOSS that you defeated in this entire game, except empress erotica, and do it all
without going back to the surface to recharge on batteries and supplies between battles.

So head to the surface, and prepare for the longest stretch of enemies to fight ever.
Also, you might want to grab some of those 2 really hard to find items that can only be
bought down here in devildom. And make sure you have a few empty spaces in your inventory.
OK then, have fun! :)
