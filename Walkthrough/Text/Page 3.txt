----------[Save Point 3 - Volcano Village]------------------------------------------------

Welcome to Volcano Village.
Check out the shop and the store, and don't forget to save.

----------[MAP 10]------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are only 2 items in this town, but you can't get them
until after you defeat the boss. So when you're done with the store,
talk to the guy blocking the entrance to the forest.
Then move 1 space away and he will copy you, so now he isn't blocking your way anymore.
There's only 1 item in the forest, so after grabbing it,
cross the bridge into the water and over to the series of small islands.
Here you will find 3 new enemies, two of which are bosses.
(a mini boss, and a main boss)

==========[FIGHT - Pirate Girl, Pirate Diva, Ghoul Beauty]================================

Like the desert, this part is long.
Mainly because of the fact that you have to cross a bunch of islands.
Just make sure you have plenty of items to assist you.

----------[MAP 11]------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------[MAP 12]------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the first section, there are 4 islands to check out.
Each one has a house on it, and 2 of them are guarded by pirates.
Fight them and grab all the stuff before heading to section 2.

In the second section, there are only 2 islands,
but the second one has a cave entrance on it.
So fight the pirate girl, get your item, and then head to the second island.
On the second island, all you have to do it fight the mini boss, and enter the cave.

----------[MAP 13]------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once in the cave, grab the two items,
before using one of the stars (you got from the houses) on the round boulder.
Just past the bridge, follow the water path to another item,
and then continue on your way to the next boulder.
Use another star, and then head for the main room.

When you get to the main room with all the lava, head left to grab another item.
You'll have to fight the mini boss again before you can use 2 more stars,
on the next two boulders, and then fight the main boss.
But before you fight the main boss, I recommend heading back to volcano village,
because this boss is tough. You do NOT want to fight her unless you restock on items.
Also you may want to clear your inventory, so you have space for the next few items.
So head back, and restock and recharge your battery.
Don't forget to save if you want to, then come back down to fight her.

Once the boss has been defeated, you might notice that some of the lava is now gone.
Now that the lava has moved, you can get the 3 chests that you couldn't before.
Just make sure to check the end of the path past the exit, to find an item,
before you take that exit back to volcano village.
Note that the item is one space away from the very end of the path.

Once back in volcano village, make sure to check the two houses,
for the items that you couldn't get before.

Once you're ready to leave Volcano Village, head east following the coastline,
and you'll run into the lava that you redirected away from the village.
Take 1 step into the water to pass the lava flow, and continue over a bridge,
straight to a second bridge. Only this one is broken.

----------[MAP 14]------------------------------------------------------------------------

This little land mass is known as the "Southern Island",
and has the 8th save point in the game.
You however won't be getting over to it, until much later.
So just remember where it is, and continue the way you were going.
Next you'll encounter a dirt path, which is the home to 3 new enemies.

==========[FIGHT - Lalapova, Mimic, Spritan]==============================================

As you follow the dirt path, you will come to a sign that tells you,
that the northern path leads to a ranch, and the southern path leads to a village.

----------[MAP 15]------------------------------------------------------------------------

You'll be going north soon enough, so head south to reach the Southeastern Port.
