----------[Save Point 6 - Castle Town]----------------------------------------------------

Welcome to Castle Town.
You can check out the shop and the store,
but you won't be able to save until you get past the guards.

----------[MAP 23]------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------[MAP 24]------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------[MAP 25]------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the way to Castle Town, make sure to grab the item
hidden in the trees just on the outskirts of town.
You can enter the tent in the trees to talk to prince fourd,
but he doesn't say anything important.
So go talk to the kid that's blocking the water path, and he'll move,
just like the one in volcano village did. Then head through the trees,
and talk to the guard. Note that it doesn't matter in which direction you face.
He tells you that the key to the castle is in one of the buildings behind the gate.

But before you go head inside, check out the house hidden in the trees.
Talk to the old man there and he tells you that he'll make an item for you,
that you can use to defeat the erotica army. But he needs one more piece to complete it.
Ironically, his granddaughter aya, over in spring village has the piece you need.
He tells you to go get it, and bring it to his laboratory hidden deeper in the trees.
You have to do this BEFORE going into the castle, so go get the "Rocket fuel",
and then come back and go into the laboratory and give it to him.
You can use the water path that was right by the royal family crest.
When you give it to him, he says it will take a while to complete,
so normally you have to do the whole castle quest first,
but here's a glitch that I like to use to get it now. After you give him the rocket fuel,
head inside the castle gates, using the crest on the guards, and save your game.

Now completely shut off the game, the whole flash window.
When you turn it back on and reload, just come back out the same way you entered,
and you'll find that his laboratory has exploded and taken out the surrounding mountains
and trees. So you can not only get your item now,
but pass straight through the mountains back to spring village whenever you want.

Now that you have your new item, head back into the castle to do the job you came to do.
But inside the castle gates is NOT a safe place like the town outside,
for you will encounter 3 new enemies.

==========[FIGHT - Nightingale, Lady Grem, Hybrid Maid]===================================

Once inside, head through the trees to the left and talk to the guard again.
He tells you where the key is, and that mercedes is already here.
He also says that he won't be able to do anything but secure your excape route.
On your way out, grab the 3 items in the area, and then go get the key.
Note that you can't get to the boulders in the castles northern gate wall yet.

Now that you have the key, you should prepare for the next boss.
But before you enter the castle, make sure to pick up 2 more stars.
That's right, it's back to the random store 3, by volcano village.
Once you've prepared for the boss, and gotten your stars, use the key to enter the castle.

----------[MAP 26]------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------[MAP 27]------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you go straight down the hall and off to the right,
you'll see that the path is blocked. A guard is sleeping right in your way,
and for some reason you can't wake him up.

There are also absolutely no items on this floor, and the chests can only be gotten later.
So the only thing you need to keep track of are the stairs that lead to the basement.
There are however 3 items in the basement. Get the one you can,
before using a star on the boulder. Then you can get the other two.
But before you head back to the second boulder,
use the hidden stairs close to the third item.
Doing so, gives you access to those chests on the first floor, but beware,
for one of them has a mimic enemy in it. (3rd from the left, in the row of 6)
Once you've gotten everything head back down to use your second star on the boulder
that's blocking the exit back up that you need to take. Now fight the queen.

==========[FIGHT - Queen]=================================================================

The thing about this fight, is that you don't have to MAX out her excitement bar.
All you have to do is take just enough clothes off to do an insertion move.
WHY? Because doing so activates a cutscene that auto-ends the fight.
And here's an explanation of what is going on.

Just as you're about to do the move, mercedes stops you, because at that moment
the queen is freed from what's controlling her. He says she broke free because
of the power of love. Not sexual desire either, but the love of a mother.
(sigh now, because you just barely avoided incest - LOL)
That's right, you're a prince. You're Prince Fourd's twin brother.
In fact, you are first in line to the throne.
But 10 years ago, the kindom was attacked by the Erotica Army, so mercedes had to take
you from the castle to protect you. Because of these events, you lost your memory,
so you only remember up to 8 years ago. When Fourd met you, he didn't say anything,
because he thought it was a trap by the erotica army.
And now that the king is dead the three of you are the only survivors of the royal family.
Now the queen want you three to band together to revive the kingdom.
She says it's possible because you grew up so splendidly.
Meaning that while the queen and your brother fourd defend the castle,
you have to be the one to finish off all the enemys forces.
So you accept the task to go to Mt. Bolbo and finish the job you started.
Now collect that last chest behind the queen, and head back out to save.

----------[MAP 28]------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you get outside, you'll notice that the castle is in ruins.
I do not believe that your battle with the queen did this.
My theory is that it was always like this, and what you saw before was just an illusion.
Of course that's just my idea, and I do like what one guy wrote about it in his walkthrough.
He said "Watch out kids. Sex blows up castles." (very funny - LOL)

Now that you've freed the queen, there are a few things you can do...
1: check out the 2 houses in castle town that was blocked by 2 people when you got here.
2: go back to random houses 1 and 2, to get their items.
(just after spring village, and at the sheep ranch) AND
3: go buy 2 stars to check out the area at the back of this castle.
(warning - one of the chests has another mimic enemy in it)
Also note that the snow areas, just like the desert, cause excitement raises.
And also just like the desert, you can get something to lessen the rise.
However, because nothing stops the raises completely,
I wouldn't bother getting anything to help here either.
One more thing to notice is the hole in the right side of the castle wall.
It's actually the passage to mt bolbo, and the path you need to take next.
So check the shop and the store, prepare for the journey, save, and get going.
Don't forget to pick up 1 more star before you leave.
