----------[Save Point 4 - Southeastern Port]----------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Southeastern Port.
Check out the shop and the store, and don't forget to save.

----------[MAP 16]------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------[MAP 17]------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are 7 items in this town, but one of them is locked in a house,
so you have to defeat the next boss before you can get it.
Get the 6 you can, and then start hunting down the entrance to the next cave system.

It's really confusing if you don't know what everyone is saying, but this is how it goes.
Step 1: talk to the kid in the upper corner of the town.
He tells you that only 1 man excaped the attack, but now he's vanished.
There might be clues at the labor union office building.
Step 2: Go to the labor union office building and get the journal. Then read it.
It tells you the location of the enemies mine, and that the entrance is blocked.
Because of everything that happened during and after the attack,
he went to a secret location to live there.
Step 3: Go back to talk to the kid again,
and he tells you that the man's hideout is on the way to the ranch.
Step 4: Go back to the intersection on the dirt path,
and take the northern route this time. But instead of following it up, just continue east.
Go into the house in the trees and talk to the man, and he'll tell you that you need the
mountain bell to open the door to the mines. He'll also tells you that he put the bell
somewhere in the forest, as well as tell you the location of the mine entrance.
Step 5: Go back to the town and check the forest just north of it.
Step 6: Go to the far southeastern point of the town,
face the wall, and use the bell 3 times.

Now before you enter the mine, go back to town and prepare,
because this place gives you another enemy. Though you will not meet her till the end,
because she's the boss, she is just as tough as the last one. If you're not prepared.

==========[FIGHT - Gunghoul]==============================================================

Also before you go into the mines,
make sure you have 2 of those stars that you used in the pirate island caves.
If you don't, head back to "Random Store 3" right by Volcano Village, and buy a couple.

----------[MAP 18]------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a lot of items in this cave,
so feel free to head back to town and sell some of it when your inventory is full.
Grab the 4 items before heading straight through both center paths,
to reach the mine cave entrance at the far end.

----------[MAP 19]------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pick up the 3 items you can, and as you travel through the cave,
note the 4 people standing around. They are blocking access to 4 more items,
that you can't get until you defeat the boss.
Use a star on the boulder blocking access to those three chests, and be carefull,
because the last chest has a mimic enemy in it.
Continue on until you reach another boulder.
Grab the chest near it, and then use your second star.
Grab the next chest, and then fight the boss.
After the boss is defeated, the path is clear for you to grab the last chest,
and the item in the water by it. Then head back to get the 4 items,
that those 4 people were blocking access to before.
And finally you can exit the caves and mines, and head back to town.

Once back at the Southeastern Port, grab that last item that you couldn't before,
because the house was locked. It's the one on the right, in the front row.
Then check the shop and the store, before you save.

Now that you're finished with the Southeastern Port, head back to the dirt road sign.
Take the north path again, only this time you actually go north.

----------[MAP 20]------------------------------------------------------------------------

You'll find yourself in a sheep ranch with "Save Point 5" and "Random House 2".
Now like with "Random House 1", you'll have to come back and get it's item later.
The person blocking it tells you that there is treasure in the lake,
and that someone else is looking for it, so you should too.
But for right now, you'll want to head to the northeastern corner of this place,
and take the path through the trees, right up along the river.

----------[MAP 21]------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first thing you'll find is a path leading back south to a tent.
If you go inside, the people there will tell you about an ominous cloud that appeared,
10 years ago, over mt. bolbo, when the Erotica Army appeared.
The next thing you'll find are 3 houses. The first two have items,
and if you go into the third, you can talk to three more people.
They say you should join the small revolt in the castle.
The third thing you'll find is a clearing with a tent.

Inside the tent, Mercedes will tell you that prince fourd excaped the castle,
and is hiding near the lake, but the king is already dead.
He also says that the queen is being controlled be the enemy,
and that you'll need the royal family crest to get into the castle to save her.
As it turns out, mercedes was the one that took the crest 10 years ago,
but he lost it in the lake during the excape.
Grab the item in the chest, and then leave. You can't get the second chest.
Head to the very end of the river to get one last item,
and then head back to the ranch and save at the save point.
Then take the path through the lake to the small peninsula.

----------[MAP 22]------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go to the other end of the peninsula, and into the tent.
There talk to prince fourd, and tell him that the king is dead.
He will tell you to find the royal family crest in the lake,
and use it to enter the castle. Once you exit the tent,
head straight up and into the water. Follow the water path around to get all 5 items,
and then head back to the peninsula to take the path through the mountains.
When you reach an intersection, take the one that leads back to the west,
and follow it back to the lake to get the royal family crest.
Now if you've been paying attention, you should recognize this spot,
for if you go north through the river here, you'll get back to Spring Village.
Feel free to do so, to check the shop, the store, and save if you want.
Then head back to the intersection, and take the path leading east to Castle Town.
