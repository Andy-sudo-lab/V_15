When you start the game, you will see a cutscene.

Your character is now 18 years old and it's time to set out on your journey.
But how can you win while half naked and with no sword or armor, you ask?
Because your enemy is immune to physical attacks like that.
The only way to to defeat them is through sex.
By doing this you free their imprisoned spirits and send them to the afterlife,
because they are being controlled by the... EROTICA ARMY !!!
And if you lose you become their slave till the day you die.

Then your friends show up to say good bye, and wish you luck.
But one is missing, so where is Aya?
Aya has been captured by Tsundele Devil,
one of the highest ranked soldiers in the Erotica Army.
Aya is now being controlled, so you must fight her to free her.

==========[FIGHT - AYA]===================================================================

After the fight, Tsundele Devel is confused at how you could have won,
so she asks who the old man is. (your training master)
For he was the former kingdom commander, Mercedes.
After she finds out she makes a temporary retreat.

Your job is to save villages that have been taken over, and defeat the enemy.
SO GET MOVING!

----------[Save Point 1 - Spring Village]-------------------------------------------------

The first thing you'll want to do is claim your prize from the building with the red roof.
Otherwise known as "The Shop". Then save your game at the dick with the light above it.

----------[MAP 1]-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now go get your two items from Mercedes in the tent.
(you have to talk to him first - he just asks why you haven't left yet)
There is a dark spot in the river that holds 3 items.
You can only get them one at a time by coming from the 3 different directions.
Get item 1 and 2 now, but you'll have to wait to get item 3 until later.
Pick up whatever you want at the store, and cross the bridge to begin your journey.
(Warp back here from time to time to check the shop - the items change)

When you crossed the bridge, you may have noticed the star in the top left corner
of the screen. That just means you're in a "random battle" zone. So expect fights.
These are the three enemies you will encounter here. (the 3rd one only in water)
Feel free to fight for a while, so you can get money to buy the items in this store,
and the "Random Store 1" just outside town.

==========[FIGHT - GothLoli Devil, Bloomarilyn, Aqua Mineraly]============================

If you want to pick up more items before going on,
head left into the "Forest of lost child".
Instead of right towards "Fishing Village". (so says the sign)

----------[MAP 2]-------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are 6 items to find here.
If you take the path down from the item in the water,
you can get the third "dark river item" marked on map 1.
And now that all the items there are gone,
you can pass strait through back to the village.
(and sell your new found booty, as well as buy more)

----------[MAP 3]-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you're ready to get going (again), cross the bridge and go right.
After crossing another longer bridge, you can follow the river south to an item.
When you have it, continue on your way only to find another store.
Buy and sell stuff here at "Random Store 1", and then continue on your way (again).

----------[MAP 4]-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After just a few more steps, you'll find "Random House 1".
You'll have to come back for the item inside later,
but there's one item in the trees behind the house
that you can get now by taking the path just before the next town.
