----------[Save Point 2 - Fishing Village]------------------------------------------------

Welcome to Fishing Village.
Check out the shop and the store, and don't forget to save.

----------[MAP 5]-------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are 5 items in the village, two of which are blocked by people.
The one in the house, and one of the ones in the water.
You won't get them until after the games first boss.
So after you get everything you can,
head into the cave past the lady blocking the water item.

----------[MAP 6]-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the first cave section, get the item.
Then head back to take the other path to exit and find cave 2.
There's 1 item in the water by the entrance to cave 2.
Once you enter cave 2, you'll see 2 more enemies.
(one's a mini boss and the other is the main boss)

==========[FIGHT - Succubus Girl, Sailor Mermaid]=========================================

As you pass through cave 2, try to remember where you started.
Because you can't see the door from where the screen is,
and that's the way you need to exit too.

----------[MAP 7]-------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's only one random item in this cave,
but there's also a chest before the mini boss.
After the mini boss, you can get 2 more chests,
but the third can't be gotten until you defeat the main boss.
Once the main boss is defeated, grab the chest
and head back the way you came to exit the cave.
When you get back to the fishing village,
don't forget to grab the 2 items that you couldn't before.
Then check the shop, buy and sell at the store, and then save.
When you're ready, head past the save point to the desert, and a new enemy.

==========[FIGHT - Crosse Cat]============================================================

The desert is large. And every time you take step it raises your excitement level.
You could get something to help with that, but nothing completely solves the problem.
So I wouldn't bother if I were you.
Just get it back to zero before the girl gets your pants off.

----------[MAP 8]-------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------[MAP 9]-------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many items in the desert. 6 in the northern part alone.
Get them, and then you can check out the "Random Store 2".
Not that there's anything to get there. So I wouldn't bother.
Then head for the southern part. Get the item near the tent and then head inside.

When you talk to Mercedes, he tells you that he's been checking out the kingdom's
castle, but couldn't get very far because you need a pass of some sort to get in.
He also tells you that only the queen has been seen lately,
so the king and prince have probably been imprisoned.
There's also a soldier in the castle that wants to help free the kingdom.
So you have to find the soldier, get into the castle, and free the royal family.
No big Right? Open the two chests and then exit.

Continue south to the end of the desert, and pick up the 4 items in the water there.
If you follow the dirt road, head north when it goes south.
You can get the last desert area item in the water just north of the "Random Store 3".
Unlike Random Stores 1 and 2, Random Store 3 changes it's items from time to time.
So like the Spring Village's Store, you should come back from time to time,
to check what's being sold.

Once you're done, head back to the dirt road and follow it south to find Volcano Village.
